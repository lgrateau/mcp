# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the repository! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository

2. Clone your fork:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mcp.git
   ```
3. Add the upstream remote:

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/ibm/mcp.git
   ```
4. Create a branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b my-feature
   ```

## Add a new MCP server

1. Find the right category for your MCP server
2. Create a new row in any of the tables:

   ```md
   | [IBM Storage Insights MCP Server](https://github.com/IBM/ibm-storageinsights-mcpserver) | Leverage key IBM Storage Insights monitoring capabilities via an MCP interface. | *see link for instructions* |
   ```

   If your MCP server can be run using `uvx`, `npx` or `docker` you can use [this tool](https://vscodemcp.com/) to generate a button for one-click installation in VSCode (or other MCP Clients).

   In the button's markdown code add `https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect?url=` before `vscode:mcp/install` to make the deeplink work from both the browser and your IDE.

3. Add the MCP Client configuration instructions to [`mcp.json`](./mcp.json)
